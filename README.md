The provided code is an implementation of a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, played through the console. 
The game initializes a 3x3 board represented as a list of characters, where each element corresponds to a position on the board. 
Players take turns marking empty positions with their respective symbols ('X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2). 
The game checks for win and draw conditions after each move. 
The `DrawBoard()` function is responsible for displaying the current state of the board, while the `CheckPosition(x)` function verifies if a chosen position is empty. 
The `CheckWin()` function examines the board for winning combinations or a draw. 
The game loop continues until there is a winner or a draw, with players inputting their moves through the console. After each move, the board is updated and displayed. 
The game declares the winner or a draw at the end of the match, clearing the console for a cleaner display. The code utilizes basic control structures, functions, and input/output operations to create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game.
